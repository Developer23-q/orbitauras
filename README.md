# Orbitauras – Prompt Optimizer Tool

Orbitauras is a lightweight web-based tool designed to help optimize prompts and streamline navigation between different pages.  
This project was built as a learning exercise to understand **folder structures, page navigation, and modular organization** in a front‑end environment.

## 🚀 Features
- **Prompt Optimization**: A simple interface to refine and test prompts.
- **Authentication Flow**: Basic login and signup pages with supporting scripts.
- **Chat Interface**: A styled chat page for experimenting with prompt interactions.
- **Modular Assets**: Organized CSS and JS files for maintainability.
- **Navigation**: Smooth transitions between `index.html`, `auth.html`, and `chat.html`.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **`assets/css/`** → Page‑specific stylesheets  
- **`assets/js/`** → Page‑specific scripts for authentication, chat, and main logic  
- **`auth.html`** → Authentication page  
- **`chat.html`** → Chat interface  
- **`index.html`** → Landing page

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to **structure a project** with clear separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, JS).
- Setting up **navigation between pages** using relative paths.
- Using `.gitignore` to keep sensitive or unnecessary files out of version control.
- Basics of **environment configuration** (`env.js`) for managing variables.
- Importance of **modular design** for scalability and readability.
